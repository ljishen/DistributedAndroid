# DistributedAndroid

Android smartphones are a new source of computing power which has not yet been fully exploited especially for those old phones. Instead of making use of idle time of smartphone, this framework tries to build an Android-based distributed system by utilizing old smartphones. Since existing implementations of many distributed execution models and schedulers are server dedicated, they are not suitable for Android platform. This project aims to migration those existing solutions to Android platform. Raft algorithm is the first step.
